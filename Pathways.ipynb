Regulates ITPR1 sensitivity to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, competing for the common binding site and acting as endogenous 'pseudoligand' whose inhibitory activity can be modulated by its phosphorylation status. Promotes the formation of contact points between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, facilitating transfer of Ca(2+) from the ER to mitochondria (PubMed:27995898). Under normal cellular conditions, functions cooperatively with BCL2L10 to limit ITPR1-mediated Ca(2+) release but, under apoptotic stress conditions, dephosphorylated which promotes dissociation of both AHCYL1 and BCL2L10 from mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes, inhibits BCL2L10 interaction with ITPR1 and leads to increased Ca(2+) transfer to mitochondria which promotes apoptosis (PubMed:27995898).

Most spliceosomal snRNPs contain a common set of Sm proteins SNRPB, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPD3, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG that assemble in a heptameric protein ring on the Sm site of the small nuclear RNA to form the core snRNP (Sm core). In the cytosol, the Sm proteins SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG are trapped in an inactive 6S pICln-Sm complex by the chaperone CLNS1A that controls the assembly of the core snRNP. To assemble core snRNPs, the SMN complex accepts the trapped 5Sm proteins from CLNS1A forming an intermediate.

      "AP2B1 ADTB2 CLAPB1\tHomo sapiens (Human)\tFUNCTION: Component of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2). Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways. Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components and appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation. AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome. The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components. Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing the CCV formation. AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. AP-2 seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface. AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules. AP-2 may also play a role in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking through the ARF6-regulated, non-clathrin pathway. During long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, AP-2 is responsible for the endocytosis of ADAM10 (PubMed:23676497). The AP-2 beta subunit acts via its C-terminal appendage domain as a scaffolding platform for endocytic accessory proteins; at least some clathrin-associated sorting proteins (CLASPs) are recognized by their [DE]-X(1,2)-F-X-X-[FL]-X-X-X-R motif. The AP-2 beta subunit binds to clathrin heavy chain, promoting clathrin lattice assembly; clathrin displaces at least some CLASPs from AP2B1 which probably then can be positioned for further coat assembly. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14745134, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14985334, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15473838, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19033387, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23676497}.\t\n",

      "SYK\tHomo sapiens (Human)\tFUNCTION: Non-receptor tyrosine kinase which mediates signal transduction downstream of a variety of transmembrane receptors including classical immunoreceptors like the B-cell receptor (BCR). Regulates several biological processes including innate and adaptive immunity, cell adhesion, osteoclast maturation, platelet activation and vascular development (PubMed:33782605). Assembles into signaling complexes with activated receptors at the plasma membrane via interaction between its SH2 domains and the receptor tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM domains. The association with the receptor can also be indirect and mediated by adapter proteins containing ITAM or partial hemITAM domains. The phosphorylation of the ITAM domains is generally mediated by SRC subfamily kinases upon engagement of the receptor. More rarely signal transduction via SYK could be ITAM-independent. Direct downstream effectors phosphorylated by SYK include VAV1, PLCG1, PI-3-kinase, LCP2 and BLNK. Initially identified as essential in B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, it is necessary for the maturation of B-cells most probably at the pro-B to pre-B transition. Activated upon BCR engagement, it phosphorylates and activates BLNK an adapter linking the activated BCR to downstream signaling adapters and effectors. It also phosphorylates and activates PLCG1 and the PKC signaling pathway. It also phosphorylates BTK and regulates its activity in B-cell antigen receptor (BCR)-coupled signaling. In addition to its function downstream of BCR also plays a role in T-cell receptor signaling. Plays also a crucial role in the innate immune response to fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens. It is for instance activated by the membrane lectin CLEC7A. Upon stimulation by fungal proteins, CLEC7A together with SYK activates immune cells inducing the production of ROS. Also activates the inflammasome and NF-kappa-B-mediated transcription of chemokines and cytokines in presence of pathogens. Regulates neutrophil degranulation and phagocytosis through activation of the MAPK signaling cascade (By similarity). Required for the stimulation of neutrophil phagocytosis by IL15 (PubMed:15123770). Also mediates the activation of dendritic cells by cell necrosis stimuli. Also involved in mast cells activation. Involved in interleukin-3/IL3-mediated signaling pathway in basophils (By similarity). Also functions downstream of receptors mediating cell adhesion. Relays for instance, integrin-mediated neutrophils and macrophages activation and P-selectin receptor/SELPG-mediated recruitment of leukocytes to inflammatory loci. Also plays a role in non-immune processes. It is for instance involved in vascular development where it may regulate blood and lymphatic vascular separation. It is also required for osteoclast development and function. Functions in the activation of platelets by collagen, mediating PLCG2 phosphorylation and activation.

      "SMN1 SMN SMNT; SMN2 SMNC\tHomo sapiens (Human)\tFUNCTION: The SMN complex catalyzes the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome, and thereby plays an important role in the splicing of cellular pre-mRNAs (PubMed:9845364, PubMed:18984161). Most spliceosomal snRNPs contain a common set of Sm proteins SNRPB, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPD3, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG that assemble in a heptameric protein ring on the Sm site of the small nuclear RNA to form the core snRNP (Sm core) (PubMed:18984161). In the cytosol, the Sm proteins SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG are trapped in an inactive 6S pICln-Sm complex by the chaperone CLNS1A that controls the assembly of the core snRNP (PubMed:18984161). To assemble core snRNPs, the SMN complex accepts the trapped 5Sm proteins from CLNS1A forming an intermediate (PubMed:18984161). Within the SMN complex, SMN1 acts as a structural backbone and together with GEMIN2 it gathers the Sm complex subunits (PubMed:21816274, PubMed:22101937, PubMed:17178713). Binding of snRNA inside 5Sm ultimately triggers eviction of the SMN complex, thereby allowing binding of SNRPD3 and SNRPB to complete assembly of the core snRNP (PubMed:31799625).

Has been described as a protein and nucleotide deglycase that catalyzes the deglycation of the Maillard adducts formed between amino groups of proteins or nucleotides and reactive carbonyl groups of glyoxals (PubMed:25416785, PubMed:28596309). But this function is rebuted by other works (PubMed:27903648, PubMed:31653696). As a protein deglycase, repairs methylglyoxal- and glyoxal-glycated proteins, and releases repaired proteins and lactate or glycolate, respectively. Deglycates cysteine, arginine and lysine residues in proteins, and thus reactivates these proteins by reversing glycation by glyoxals. Acts on early glycation intermediates (hemithioacetals and aminocarbinols), preventing the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) that cause irreversible damage (PubMed:25416785, PubMed:28013050, PubMed:26995087). Also functions as a nucleotide deglycase able to repair glycated guanine in the free nucleotide pool (GTP, GDP, GMP, dGTP) and in DNA and RNA. Is thus involved in a major nucleotide repair system named guanine glycation repair (GG repair), dedicated to reversing methylglyoxal and glyoxal damage via nucleotide sanitization and direct nucleic acid repair (PubMed:28596309). Protects histones from adduction by methylglyoxal, controls the levels of methylglyoxal-derived argininine modifications on chromatin (PubMed:30150385). Able to remove the glycations and restore histone 3, histone glycation disrupts both local and global chromatin architecture by altering histone-DNA interactions as well as histone acetylation and ubiquitination levels (PubMed:30150385, PubMed:30894531). Displays a very low glyoxalase activity that may reflect its deglycase activity (PubMed:22523093, PubMed:31653696, PubMed:28993701).

The 26S proteasome plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins that could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Associated with the PA200 or PA28, the 20S proteasome mediates ubiquitin-independent protein degradation. This type of proteolysis is required in several pathways including spermatogenesis (20S-PA200 complex) or generation of a subset of MHC class I-presented antigenic peptides (20S-PA28 complex). Binds to the C-terminus of CDKN1A and thereby mediates its degradation.

      "BCL6 BCL5 LAZ3 ZBTB27 ZNF51\tHomo sapiens (Human)\tFUNCTION: Transcriptional repressor mainly required for germinal center (GC) formation and antibody affinity maturation which has different mechanisms of action specific to the lineage and biological functions. Forms complexes with different corepressors and histone deacetylases to repress the transcriptional expression of different subsets of target genes. Represses its target genes by binding directly to the DNA sequence 5'-TTCCTAGAA-3' (BCL6-binding site) or indirectly by repressing the transcriptional activity of transcription factors. In GC B-cells, represses genes that function in differentiation, inflammation, apoptosis and cell cycle control, also autoregulates its transcriptional expression and up-regulates, indirectly, the expression of some genes important for GC reactions, such as AICDA, through the repression of microRNAs expression, like miR155. An important function is to allow GC B-cells to proliferate very rapidly in response to T-cell dependent antigens and tolerate the physiological DNA breaks required for immunglobulin class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation without inducing a p53/TP53-dependent apoptotic response. In follicular helper CD4(+) T-cells (T(FH) cells), promotes the expression of T(FH)-related genes but inhibits the differentiation of T(H)1, T(H)2 and T(H)17 cells. Also required for the establishment and maintenance of immunological memory for both T- and B-cells. Suppresses macrophage proliferation through competition with STAT5 for STAT-binding motifs binding on certain target genes, such as CCL2 and CCND2. In response to genotoxic stress, controls cell cycle arrest in GC B-cells in both p53/TP53-dependedent and -independent manners. Besides, also controls neurogenesis through the alteration of the composition of NOTCH-dependent transcriptional complexes at selective NOTCH targets, such as HES5, including the recruitment of the deacetylase SIRT1 and resulting in an epigenetic silencing leading to neuronal differentiation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10981963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12402037, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12414651, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12504096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15454082, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15577913, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16142238, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17828269, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18212045, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18280243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22113614, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23166356, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23911289, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9649500}.\t\n",

Mediates monoubiquitination as well as 'Lys-6', 'Lys-11', 'Lys-48'-linked and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of substrates depending on the context (PubMed:19229105, PubMed:20889974, PubMed:25621951, PubMed:32047033, PubMed:25474007). Participates in the removal and/or detoxification of abnormally folded or damaged protein by mediating 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of misfolded proteins such as PARK7: 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitinated misfolded proteins are then recognized by HDAC6, leading to their recruitment to aggresomes, followed by degradation (PubMed:17846173, PubMed:19229105). Mediates 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of a 22 kDa O-linked glycosylated isoform of SNCAIP, possibly playing a role in Lewy-body formation (PubMed:11431533, PubMed:11590439, PubMed:15105460, PubMed:19229105, PubMed:15728840). Mediates monoubiquitination of BCL2, thereby acting as a positive regulator of autophagy (PubMed:20889974). Protects against mitochondrial dysfunction during cellular stress, by acting downstream of PINK1 to coordinate mitochondrial quality control mechanisms that remove and replace dysfunctional mitochondrial components (PubMed:32047033, PubMed:19029340, PubMed:19966284, PubMed:23620051, PubMed:24896179, PubMed:25527291, PubMed:18957282, PubMed:21376232, PubMed:22396657, PubMed:24660806, PubMed:25474007, PubMed:24784582, PubMed:11439185, PubMed:22082830, PubMed:23933751). Depending on the severity of mitochondrial damage and/or dysfunction, activity ranges from preventing apoptosis and stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis to regulating mitochondrial dynamics and eliminating severely damaged mitochondria via mitophagy (PubMed:32047033, PubMed:19029340, PubMed:19801972, PubMed:19966284, PubMed:23620051, PubMed:24896179, PubMed:25527291, PubMed:21376232, PubMed:22396657, PubMed:11439185, PubMed:22082830, PubMed:23933751, PubMed:33499712). Activation and recruitment onto the outer membrane of damaged/dysfunctional mitochondria (OMM) requires PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of both PRKN and ubiquitin (PubMed:24660806, PubMed:25474007, PubMed:24784582, PubMed:25527291). After mitochondrial damage, functions with PINK1 to mediate the decision between mitophagy or preventing apoptosis by inducing either the poly- or monoubiquitination of VDAC1, respectively; polyubiquitination of VDAC1 promotes mitophagy, while monoubiquitination of VDAC1 decreases mitochondrial calcium influx which ultimately inhibits apoptosis (PubMed:32047033). When cellular stress results in irreversible mitochondrial damage, promotes the autophagic degradation of dysfunctional depolarized mitochondria (mitophagy) by promoting the ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins such as TOMM20, RHOT1/MIRO1, MFN1 and USP30 (PubMed:19029340, PubMed:19966284, PubMed:21753002, PubMed:23620051, PubMed:24896179, PubMed:25527291, PubMed:22396657, PubMed:23933751). Preferentially assembles 'Lys-6'-, 'Lys-11'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains, leading to mitophagy (PubMed:25621951, PubMed:32047033). The PINK1-PRKN pathway also promotes fission of damaged mitochondria by PINK1-mediated phosphorylation which promotes the PRKN-dependent degradation of mitochondrial proteins involved in fission such as MFN2 (PubMed:23620051). This prevents the refusion of unhealthy mitochondria with the mitochondrial network or initiates mitochondrial fragmentation facilitating their later engulfment by autophagosomes (PubMed:23620051). Regulates motility of damaged mitochondria via the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of MIRO1 and MIRO2; in motor neurons, this likely inhibits mitochondrial intracellular anterograde transport along the axons which probably increases the chance of the mitochondria undergoing mitophagy in the soma (PubMed:22396657). Involved in mitochondrial biogenesis via the 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination of transcriptional repressor ZNF746/PARIS which leads to its subsequent proteasomal degradation and allows activation of the transcription factor PPARGC1A (PubMed:21376232). Limits the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (PubMed:18541373). Regulates cyclin-E during neuronal apoptosis (PubMed:12628165).

In contrast, ALKAL1 is not a potent physiological ligand for ALK (PubMed:34646012). Ligand-binding to the extracellular domain induces tyrosine kinase activation, leading to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (PubMed:34819673).

Required for normal protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and the cell membrane (By similarity). Together with p115/USO1 and STX5, involved in vesicle tethering and fusion at the cis-Golgi membrane to maintain the stacked and inter-connected structure of the Golgi apparatus. Plays a central role in mitotic Golgi disassembly: phosphorylation at Ser-37 by CDK1 at the onset of mitosis inhibits the interaction with p115/USO1, preventing tethering of COPI vesicles and thereby inhibiting transport through the Golgi apparatus during mitosis (By similarity). Also plays a key role in spindle pole assembly and centrosome organization (PubMed:26165940). Promotes the mitotic spindle pole assembly by activating the spindle assembly factor TPX2 to nucleate microtubules around the Golgi and capture them to couple mitotic membranes to the spindle: upon phosphorylation at the onset of mitosis, GOLGA2 interacts with importin-alpha via the nuclear localization signal region, leading to recruit importin-alpha to the Golgi membranes and liberate the spindle assembly factor TPX2 from importin-alpha. TPX2 then activates AURKA kinase and stimulates local microtubule nucleation. Upon filament assembly, nascent microtubules are further captured by GOLGA2, thus linking Golgi membranes to the spindle (PubMed:19242490, PubMed:26165940). Regulates the meiotic spindle pole assembly, probably via the same mechanism (By similarity). Also regulates the centrosome organization (PubMed:18045989, PubMed:19109421).

      "EIF2S3 EIF2G\tHomo sapiens (Human)\tFUNCTION: As a subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2), involved in the early steps of protein synthesis. In the presence of GTP, eIF-2 forms a ternary complex with initiator tRNA Met-tRNAi and then recruits the 40S ribosomal complex and initiation factors eIF-1, eIF-1A and eIF-3 to form the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC), a step that determines the rate of protein translation. The 43S PIC binds to mRNA and scans downstream to the initiation codon, where it forms a 48S initiation complex by codon-anticodon base pairing. This leads to the displacement of eIF-1 to allow GTPase-activating protein (GAP) eIF-5-mediated hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP. Hydrolysis of GTP and release of Pi, which makes GTP hydrolysis irreversible, causes the release of the eIF-2-GDP binary complex from the 40S subunit, an event that is essential for the subsequent joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit to form an elongation-competent 80S ribosome. In order for eIF-2 to recycle and catalyze another round of initiation, the GDP bound to eIF-2 must be exchanged with GTP by way of a reaction catalyzed by GDP-GTP exchange factor (GEF) eIF-2B (By similarity).

Coordinates actin remodeling through tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins controlling cytoskeleton dynamics like WASF3 (involved in branch formation); ANXA1 (involved in membrane anchoring); DBN1, DBNL, CTTN, RAPH1 and ENAH (involved in signaling); or MAPT and PXN (microtubule-binding proteins). Phosphorylation of WASF3 is critical for the stimulation of lamellipodia formation and cell migration. Involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility through phosphorylation of key regulators of these processes such as BCAR1, CRK, CRKL, DOK1, EFS or NEDD9 (PubMed:22810897). Phosphorylates multiple receptor tyrosine kinases and more particularly promotes endocytosis of EGFR, facilitates the formation of neuromuscular synapses through MUSK, inhibits PDGFRB-mediated chemotaxis and modulates the endocytosis of activated B-cell receptor complexes. Other substrates which are involved in endocytosis regulation are the caveolin (CAV1) and RIN1. Moreover, ABL1 regulates the CBL family of ubiquitin ligases that drive receptor down-regulation and actin remodeling. Phosphorylation of CBL leads to increased EGFR stability.

Ligand binding triggers receptor homo- and/or heterodimerization and autophosphorylation on key cytoplasmic residues. The phosphorylated receptor recruits adapter proteins like GRB2 which in turn activates complex downstream signaling cascades. Activates at least 4 major downstream signaling cascades including the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK, PI3 kinase-AKT, PLCgamma-PKC and STATs modules (PubMed:27153536). May also activate the NF-kappa-B signaling cascade (PubMed:11116146).

      "TP53 P53\tHomo sapiens (Human)\tFUNCTION: Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:9840937, PubMed:24652652). Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:9840937, PubMed:24652652). One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. Its pro-apoptotic activity is activated via its interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 (PubMed:12524540). However, this activity is inhibited when the interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 is displaced by PPP1R13L/iASPP (PubMed:12524540). In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seems to have an effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis.

May play a role in synaptic transmission by modulating calcium and proton dynamics at the synaptic vesicles. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:G5E829, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29104511, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35358416}.\tapical plasma membrane [GO:0016324]; basolateral plasma membrane [GO:0016323]; cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane [GO:0009898]; dendritic spine membrane [GO:0032591]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; GABA-ergic synapse [GO:0098982]; glutamatergic synapse [GO:0098978]; immunological synapse [GO:0001772]; intracellular membrane-bounded organelle [GO:0043231]; membrane [GO:0016020]; membrane raft [GO:0045121]; neuronal cell body membrane [GO:0032809]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; photoreceptor ribbon synapse [GO:0098684]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; presynaptic active zone membrane [GO:0048787]; presynaptic membrane [GO:0042734]; synaptic vesicle membrane [GO:0030672]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; ATP hydrolysis activity [GO:0016887]; ATPase-coupled cation transmembrane transporter activity [GO:0019829]; calcium ion transmembrane transporter activity [GO:0015085]; calmodulin binding [GO:0005516]; metal ion binding [GO:0046872]; P-type calcium transporter activity [GO:0005388]; PDZ domain binding [GO:0030165]; aging [GO:0007568]; brain development [GO:0007420]; calcium ion export [GO:1901660]; calcium ion export across plasma membrane [GO:1990034]; cellular calcium ion homeostasis [GO:0006874]; cellular response to corticosterone stimulus [GO:0071386]; cellular response to vitamin D [GO:0071305]; ion transmembrane transport [GO:0034220]; negative regulation of cytokine production [GO:0001818]; negative regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration [GO:0051481]; neural retina development [GO:0003407]; positive regulation of bone mineralization [GO:0030501]; positive regulation of calcium ion transport [GO:0051928]; regulation of blood pressure [GO:0008217]; regulation of cardiac conduction [GO:1903779]; regulation of cellular response to insulin stimulus [GO:1900076]; regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration [GO:0051480]; regulation of vascular associated smooth muscle contraction [GO:0003056]; response to cold [GO:0009409]\n",
      "SCRIB CRIB1 KIAA0147 LAP4 SCRB1 VARTUL\tHomo sapiens (Human)\t\tFUNCTION: Scaffold protein involved in different aspects of polarized cell differentiation regulating epithelial and neuronal morphogenesis and T-cell polarization (PubMed:15182672, PubMed:16344308, PubMed:19041750, PubMed:18716323, PubMed:18641685, PubMed:16965391, PubMed:27380321). Via its interaction with CRTAM, required for the late phase polarization of a subset of CD4+ T-cells, which in turn regulates TCR-mediated proliferation and IFNG and IL22 production (By similarity). Most probably functions in the establishment of apico-basal cell polarity (PubMed:16344308, PubMed:19041750). May function in cell proliferation regulating progression from G1 to S phase and as a positive regulator of apoptosis for instance during acinar morphogenesis of the mammary epithelium (PubMed:16965391, PubMed:19041750). May also function in cell migration and adhesion and hence regulate cell invasion through MAPK signaling (PubMed:18716323, PubMed:18641685). May play a role in exocytosis and in the targeting of synaptic vesicles to synapses (PubMed:15182672). Functions as an activator of Rac GTPase activity. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q80U72, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15182672, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16344308, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16965391, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18641685, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18716323, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19041750, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27380321}.\tadherens junction [GO:0005912]; basolateral plasma membrane [GO:0016323]; cell junction [GO:0030054]; cell-cell contact zone [GO:0044291]; cell-cell junction [GO:0005911]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; extrinsic component of postsynaptic density membrane [GO:0099147]; glutamatergic synapse [GO:0098978]; immunological synapse [GO:0001772]; lamellipodium [GO:0030027]; myelin sheath abaxonal region [GO:0035748]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; postsynaptic density [GO:0014069]; presynapse [GO:0098793]; Scrib-APC-beta-catenin complex [GO:0034750]; cadherin binding [GO:0045296]; activation of GTPase activity [GO:0090630]; apoptotic process involved in morphogenesis [GO:0060561]; astrocyte cell migration [GO:0043615]; auditory receptor cell stereocilium organization [GO:0060088]; cell migration [GO:0016477]; cell population proliferation [GO:0008283]; cell-cell adhesion [GO:0098609]; cochlear nucleus development [GO:0021747]; establishment of apical/basal cell polarity [GO:0035089]; establishment of T cell polarity [GO:0001768]; establishment or maintenance of epithelial cell apical/basal polarity [GO:0045197]; mammary gland duct morphogenesis [GO:0060603]; negative regulation of activated T cell proliferation [GO:0046007]; negative regulation of mitotic cell cycle [GO:0045930]; neural tube closure [GO:0001843]; neurotransmitter receptor transport postsynaptic membrane to endosome [GO:0098968]; neurotransmitter receptor transport, endosome to postsynaptic membrane [GO:0098887]; polarized epithelial cell differentiation [GO:0030859]; positive chemotaxis [GO:0050918]; positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]; positive regulation of receptor recycling [GO:0001921]; positive regulation of type II interferon production [GO:0032729]; post-anal tail morphogenesis [GO:0036342]; protein localization to adherens junction [GO:0071896]; receptor clustering [GO:0043113]; receptor localization to synapse [GO:0097120]; regulation of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor internalization [GO:0099149]; synaptic vesicle endocytosis [GO:0048488]; synaptic vesicle targeting [GO:0016080]; wound healing [GO:0042060]\n"
